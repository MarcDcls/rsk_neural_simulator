# RSK Neural Simulator

Repository dedicated to implementing a neural simulator for the Robot-Soccer-Kit (RSK) project: https://robot-soccer-kit.github.io/. This simulator aims to reduce the sim-to-real gap by providing a more accurate representation of the dynamics of the robots used in RSK than traditional physics engines.
